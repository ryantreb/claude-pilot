# Managing Context in Long Claude Code Sessions

If you've used Claude Code for more than a quick one-off task, you've hit the wall. You're deep into a refactor, everything is flowing, and suddenly Claude starts forgetting what you told it ten minutes ago. Your carefully built context — the files you discussed, the decisions you made, the architecture you agreed on — evaporates.

This is the context window problem, and it's the single biggest friction point in AI-assisted development today.

## What Is the Context Window?

Every conversation with Claude exists within a fixed-size buffer called the context window. Think of it as Claude's working memory. Everything — your messages, Claude's responses, file contents, tool outputs, system prompts — competes for space in this window.

Claude's context window is large (200K tokens with Opus, Sonnet, and Haiku), but it fills up faster than you'd expect. A single large file read can consume thousands of tokens. A few rounds of debugging with stack traces and log output can eat through 20-30% of the window in minutes.

When the window fills up, Claude Code triggers **autocompaction** — it summarizes the conversation to free space. This is where things get painful.

## What Happens During Autocompaction

When context reaches its internal threshold (roughly 95% full), Claude Code compresses the conversation. The system creates a summary of what happened, discarding the original messages.

The problem is that summaries are lossy by nature. Key details get dropped:

- **Specific code decisions** — "We chose approach B because approach A had a race condition with the database pool" becomes "implemented the feature"
- **File locations and line numbers** — The exact spots you were working on get generalized
- **Debugging context** — The chain of reasoning that led to finding a bug vanishes
- **Partial progress** — Half-finished work gets described vaguely instead of preserved precisely

After compaction, you'll find yourself re-explaining decisions, re-reading files Claude already analyzed, and re-doing work that was already done. It's the AI equivalent of a coworker who forgot everything from yesterday's meeting.

## How Fast Does Context Fill Up?

Faster than you think. Here's a rough breakdown of token costs for common operations:

| Operation | Approximate Token Cost |
|-----------|----------------------|
| Reading a 200-line file | 2,000-4,000 tokens |
| Large stack trace | 1,000-3,000 tokens |
| Running tests with output | 2,000-5,000 tokens |
| System prompt + rules | 5,000-15,000 tokens |
| Each message round-trip | 500-2,000 tokens |

A typical development session might look like this:

1. System prompt and rules load: **10,000 tokens**
2. Read 3-4 files to understand context: **12,000 tokens**
3. Discuss approach and make decisions: **5,000 tokens**
4. Implement changes across files: **15,000 tokens**
5. Run tests and debug failures: **20,000 tokens**
6. Fix issues and re-run tests: **15,000 tokens**

That's roughly 77,000 tokens — and you're barely halfway through a complex task. Add a few more debugging cycles, some large file reads, or a refactor that touches many files, and you're approaching the compaction threshold.

## Common Strategies (And Their Limitations)

### Strategy 1: Keep Sessions Short

The most common advice is to use Claude Code for small, focused tasks. Fix one bug per session. Implement one function at a time.

**The limitation:** Real development work isn't neatly decomposable into 10-minute chunks. Refactoring an authentication system, implementing a new API with tests, or debugging a complex race condition all require sustained context that spans many interactions.

### Strategy 2: Write Everything Down

Some developers maintain external notes — a markdown file with decisions, file references, and progress. When context compacts, they paste the notes back in.

**The limitation:** This works, but it's manual, tedious, and error-prone. You're essentially doing the AI's memory management by hand, which defeats the purpose of having an AI assistant.

### Strategy 3: Use Compact Prompts

Being economical with context helps. Avoid pasting entire files when you only need a function. Reference files by path instead of including their contents.

**The limitation:** This requires constant vigilance about token usage — a cognitive overhead that takes you out of the flow state you're trying to achieve. And even with careful management, complex tasks will still exhaust the window.

### Strategy 4: Start Fresh and Re-establish Context

When context gets messy, start a new conversation and re-explain everything from scratch.

**The limitation:** Re-establishing context takes significant time and tokens itself. You're spending 20-30% of your fresh context window just getting back to where you were.

## The Real Problem: Sessions Are Disposable

The fundamental issue isn't the size of the context window — it's that **sessions are treated as disposable**. When a session ends or compacts, the accumulated understanding is lost. Every new session starts from zero.

This creates a ceiling on the complexity of work you can do with AI assistance. Simple tasks that fit in one session work great. Anything requiring sustained effort across many interactions hits the context wall.

What's needed is a way to make sessions **continuous** — to preserve the accumulated understanding across context boundaries, automatically, without manual intervention.

## Context Preservation: Automatic Continuity

This is the problem that Claude Pilot's context management was designed to solve. Instead of treating the context limit as a hard wall that destroys your progress, auto-compaction turns it into a seamless checkpoint.

Here's how it works:

### 1. Context Monitoring

A background hook continuously tracks context usage percentage. At 65%, it warns that context is getting high. At 75%+, state-preservation hooks prepare for Claude Code's built-in auto-compaction at ~83%.

### 2. State Preservation

Before auto-compaction fires, the current state is captured:
- What task is being worked on
- What's been completed
- What's in progress
- What needs to happen next
- Key decisions and their rationale

This state is saved to persistent memory (observations that survive across compaction cycles and sessions).

### 3. Automatic Restoration

After compaction, the session continues with preserved context injected. Work picks up exactly where it left off — same task, same progress, same understanding of the codebase.

### 4. Persistent Memory

Beyond session continuity, a persistent memory system (powered by SQLite and MCP) stores observations from every session. When a new session starts, relevant past observations are automatically injected. This means:

- Decisions made three sessions ago are still accessible
- Debugging discoveries from last week inform today's work
- Codebase understanding accumulates over time, not just within a session

### The Result

With auto-compaction and persistent memory, a complex refactor that would normally require 3-4 separate sessions (each losing context from the previous ones) becomes one continuous flow. The developer never has to re-explain context, re-read files, or re-make decisions.

The context window still has a fixed size, but its boundary becomes invisible. Work flows continuously across session boundaries as if the window were infinite.

## Practical Tips for Long Sessions

Whether or not you use a continuity system, these practices help maximize the value of your context window:

### Front-Load Important Context

Put the most critical information early in the session. Claude pays more attention to content at the beginning and end of the context window (the primacy and recency effects apply to LLMs too).

### Use Structured Plans

For complex tasks, create a plan file early in the session. This gives Claude a persistent reference point that survives even partial context loss. The plan file lives on disk, so it can always be re-read.

### Reference Files by Path

Instead of asking Claude to "look at the auth code," say "read `src/auth/middleware.ts` lines 45-80." Precise references consume less context than exploratory reads.

### Commit Frequently

Regular commits create checkpoints in your work. If context is lost, you can reference the git log to understand what was already done. `git diff` is cheaper than re-reading all modified files.

### Watch for the Signs

Context degradation doesn't happen suddenly. Watch for these signs:

- Claude starts asking about things you already discussed
- Responses become more generic and less specific to your codebase
- Claude suggests approaches you already rejected
- File references become vague ("the main file" instead of the specific path)

When you see these signs, it's time to either compact intentionally or start a new session with preserved context.

## The Future of Context Management

The context window problem isn't permanent. Context windows are getting larger with each model generation, and techniques like persistent memory, session continuity, and intelligent summarization are making the boundaries less painful.

But today, context management is a real skill that separates productive AI-assisted development from frustrating experiences. Understanding how context works, when it degrades, and how to preserve it across sessions is as important as knowing how to write good prompts.

The developers who get the most out of Claude Code aren't the ones who write the cleverest prompts — they're the ones who manage context effectively, either manually or with tools that automate it.
